# Temperature-Monitoring-using-8051-and-LM35

- LM35 is a temperature sensor which gives an output in millivolts with corresponding temperature value. 
I have used a non-inverting op-amp amplifier and ADC0808 which is 8bit ADC for converting into digital form and a Numeric 16x2 LCD for displaying.
- Used Keil uVisoion as IDE and Assembly language.
